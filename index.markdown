I am a macroeconomist working on inflation, aggregate productivity, and firm behavior. I joined Northwestern's Department of Economics as an Assistant Professor in 2025. 

I received a BA in Economics from Stanford in 2016 and Ph.D. in Business Economics in 2024 from Harvard. Previously, I worked at a payments startup in San Francisco and the Boston Consulting Group.
