![Kunal Sangani headshot](/assets/images/kunalsangani_headshot_cropped.jpeg){:class='kunal'}

I'm a fifth-year PhD student at Harvard with interests in macroeconomics and finance. My work relates to inflation, aggregate productivity, and firm behavior. 

**I am on the 2023â€“2024 job market.**

Previously, I worked at Bolt, a payments startup in San Francisco, and the Boston Consulting Group.
