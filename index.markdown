I am an economist with interests in macroeconomics and finance. My work relates to inflation, aggregate productivity, and firm behavior. 

I am a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford from 2024-2025 and will join the Northwestern Economics department as an Assistant Professor starting in 2025.

I earned a Ph.D. in Business Economics in 2024 from Harvard, advised by Gabriel Chodorow-Reich, Ludwig Straub, and Andrei Shleifer. Previously, I worked at Bolt, a payments startup in San Francisco, and the Boston Consulting Group.
