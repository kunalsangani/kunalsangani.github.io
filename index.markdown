I'm a PhD candidate in Business Economics at Harvard. My research relates to productivity, inflation, and firm behavior.

Previously, I worked at [Bolt](https://bolt.com), a payments startup in San Francisco, and the [Boston Consulting Group](https://bcg.com). Other stints include [Google](https://careers.google.com/programs/apm/) and the [Council of Economic Advisers](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/docs/ERP_2016_Book_Complete%20JA.pdf).

You can contact me by [email](mailto:8ksangani@gmail.com), or connect  on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ksangani8) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kunalsangani/).
