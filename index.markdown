I'm a PhD Candidate in Business Economics at Harvard. My research interests are in finance, macroeconomics, productivity and innovation. 

Previously, I worked at [Bolt](https://bolt.com), a payments startup in San Francisco, and the [Boston Consulting Group](https://bcg.com). Other stints include [Google](https://chromeenterprise.google/os/) and the [Council of Economic Advisers](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/docs/ERP_2016_Book_Complete%20JA.pdf).
