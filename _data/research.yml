      abstract: >-
        The Law of Diminishing Elasticity of Demand (Harrod 1936) conjectures 
        that price elasticity declines with income. I provide empirical evidence 
        in support of Harrod's conjecture using data on household transactions 
        and wholesale costs. Over the observed set of purchases, high-income 
        households pay 14pp higher retail markups than low-income households. 
        Half of the differences in markups paid across households is due to 
        differences in markups paid at the same store. Conversely, products with 
        a high-income customer base charge higher markups: a 10pp higher share 
        of customers with over $100K in income is associated with a 4–8pp 
        higher retail markup. A search model in which households' search intensity
        depends on their opportunity cost of time can replicate these facts. 
        Through the lens of the model, changes in the income distribution since 
        1950 account for a 14pp rise in retail markups, with 30% of the 
        increase since 1980 due to growing income dispersion. This rise in markups consists 
        of within-firm markup increases as well as a reallocation of sales to 
        high-markup firms, which occurs without any changes to the nature of 
        firm production or competition.

      abstract: >-
        We document a shift in the market impact of the press conference given by the Federal Reserve Chair at the close of FOMC meetings. 
        Using intraday trading data, we find that market volatility is more than three times higher during 
        press conferences given by current Chair Jerome Powell than during press conferences by predecessors 
        Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke. Press conferences since the start of Covid-19 are largely responsible 
        for the heightened market volatility during Chair Powell's conferences. During this period, 
        we find that the market tends to move in the opposite direction during the press conferences 
        compared to its movement following the FOMC statement publication. In contrast, press 
        conferences by Chairs Bernanke and Yellen tended to reinforce the market's initial reaction to 
        the information released in the FOMC statement. Text analysis of the Q\&A portions of Powell’s 
        press conferences suggests that his choice of language correlates with these market movements. 
        We find that Fed communications during the recent period have been less effective in reducing 
        forward-looking interest rate uncertainty.

        How does an increase in market size, say due to globalization, affect welfare? We study 
        this question using a model with monopolistic competition, heterogeneous markups, and fixed
        costs. We characterize the change in welfare in the decentralized equilibrium, and decompose
        it into changes in technical efficiency and allocative efficiency. Allocative efficiency changes due
        to three different types of reallocations: (1) reallocations across firms with heterogeneous price elasticities 
        due to increased entry, (2) reallocations due to the exit of marginally 
        profitable firms, and (3) reallocations due to changes in firms’ markups. 
        Whereas the second and third effects have ambiguous implications for 
        welfare, the first effect, which we call the Darwinian effect, always 
        increases welfare regardless of the shape of demand curves. We 
        non-parametrically calibrate residual demand curves with firm-level data 
        from Belgian manufacturing firms and quantify our theoretical results. 
        We find that mild increasing returns at the micro level can catalyze 
        large increasing returns at the macro level. These aggregate gains are 
        due to the Darwinian effect, which reallocates resources from low- to 
        high-markup firms, and not the death of unproductive firms (2) or 
        changes in markups (3). Our results suggest that a policy-maker can 
        harness Darwinian reallocations in an economy with fixed resources by 
        subsidizing firm entry costs.

      abstract: >-
        We propose a supply-side channel for the transmission of monetary policy. 
        We show that in an economy with heterogeneous firms and endogenous markups, 
        demand shocks have first-order effects on aggregate productivity. If high-markup firms 
        have lower pass-throughs than low-markup firms, as is consistent with the 
        empirical evidence, then a monetary easing reallocates resources to high-markup 
        firms and alleviates misallocation. In this case, positive “demand shocks” 
        are accompanied by endogenous positive “supply shocks” that raise output and 
        productivity, lower inflation, and flatten the Phillips curve. We derive a 
        tractable four-equation dynamic model and use it to show that monetary shocks 
        generate a procyclical hump-shaped response in TFP and endogenous cost-push 
        shocks in the New Keynesian Phillips curve. A calibration of the model 
        suggests that the supply-side effect increases the half-life of a monetary shock’s 
        effect on output by about 30% and amplifies the cumulative effect on output 
        by about 70%. We provide empirical evidence of the micro-level reallocations 
        that generate procyclical TFP using identified monetary shocks.

      abstract: >-
        Impact investing often takes place in developing or frontier 
        markets, and, as a result, impact investors will likely 
        encounter problems unique to investing in countries where 
        legal institutions are weak, ineffective, or entirely absent. 
        The absence of credible legal institutions—and hence the lack 
        of credible penalties for misbehavior—exposes the impact 
        investor to a wider berth of actions from counterparties, 
        as well as political and market uncertainties often present 
        in these settings. This paper discusses the various risks and 
        describes mitigation techniques.

      abstract: >-
        Rampant informality in developing economies proves to be a 
        major obstacle to public revenue collection, limiting investment 
        in crucial public infrastructure. The model presented in this 
        paper sheds light on inter-firm mechanisms that motivate firms 
        to either transact formally or transact informally and evade 
        taxes. The formulation allows us to predict comparative statics 
        on a variety of parameters, including the effective tax rate, 
        the likelihood of audit, the penalties levered against firms 
        caught transacting informally, and the distribution of firm sizes 
        in the economy. Empirical support for each of these predictions 
        is discussed. In particular, the model provides theoretical 
        underpinnings for predicting the effect of multinational entry and 
        trade liberalization on the size of the informal sector.
