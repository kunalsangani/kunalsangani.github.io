      abstract: >-
        How does an increase in market size, say due to globalization, affect welfare? We study 
        this question using a model with monopolistic competition, heterogeneous markups, and fixed
        costs. We characterize the change in welfare in the decentralized equilibrium, and decompose
        it into changes in technical efficiency and allocative efficiency. Allocative efficiency changes due
        to three different types of reallocations: (1) reallocations across firms with heterogeneous price elasticities 
        due to increased entry, (2) reallocations due to the exit of marginally 
        profitable firms, and (3) reallocations due to changes in firms’ markups. 
        Whereas the second and third effects have ambiguous implications for 
        welfare, the first effect, which we call the Darwinian effect, always 
        increases welfare regardless of the shape of demand curves. We 
        non-parametrically calibrate residual demand curves with firm-level data 
        from Belgian manufacturing firms and quantify our theoretical results. 
        We find that mild increasing returns at the micro level can catalyze 
        large increasing returns at the macro level. These aggregate gains are 
        due to the Darwinian effect, which reallocates resources from low- to 
        high-markup firms, and not the death of unproductive firms (2) or 
        changes in markups (3). Our results suggest that a policy-maker can 
        harness Darwinian reallocations in an economy with fixed resources by 
        subsidizing firm entry costs.

          href: https://voxeu.org/article/monetary-policy-and-productivity-new-transmission-channel
      abstract: >-
        We propose a supply-side channel for the transmission of monetary policy. 
        We show that in an economy with heterogeneous firms and endogenous markups, 
        monetary shocks have first-order effects on aggregate productivity. 
        If high-markup firms have lower pass-throughs than low-markup firms, 
        as is consistent with the empirical evidence, then a monetary easing 
        generates an endogenous positive “supply shock” that amplifies the positive 
        “demand shock” on output. The result is a flattening of the Phillips curve. 
        This effect is distinct from another mechanism discussed at length in the 
        real rigidities literature: a monetary easing leads to a reduction in desired 
        markups because of strategic complementarities in pricing. We derive a 
        tractable four-equation dynamic model, disciplined by four sufficient 
        statistics from the distribution of firms, and use it to show that a monetary 
        easing generates a procyclical hump-shaped response in aggregate TFP and 
        countercyclical dispersion in firm-level TFPR. In the data, in line with 
        the model’s predictions, we observe both procyclical aggregate productivity 
        and reallocations to high-markup firms during expansions. A calibration 
        using firm-level pass-throughs suggests that the supply-side channel is 
        quantitatively as important as real rigidities, and amplifies both the 
        impact and persistence of monetary shocks. Moreover, this channel becomes 
        stronger, and the Phillips curve becomes flatter, with increases in 
        industrial concentration.

      title: Venture-Backed Successes and Entrepreneur Herding
      abstract: >-
        How does the success of an existing startup influence the 
        business ideas that aspiring entrepreneurs pursue? Do 
        venture-backed successes spawn other "copycat" companies, 
        or are entrepreneurs discouraged from entering markets where 
        they will be forced to confront a well-funded competitor? 
        I use ProductHunt, an online platform where entrepreneurs 
        share early product and business ideas, to isolate how the 
        ideas pursued by entrepreneurs change in the aftermath of large 
        funding rounds and acquisitions. Following the acquisition of 
        venture-backed companies, I find a significant uptick in 
        ProductHunt posts similar to the acquired company: the average 
        post 90 days after the acquisition announcement is 40-70% more 
        similar to the acquired company than posts preceding the 
        acquisition. A similar (though more modest) herding effect 
        follows the announcement of a company's first funding round 
        over $100M. This herding behavior suggests that aspiring 
        entrepreneurs place more weight on the *market size signal* 
        from an acquisition or funding round relative to the 
        *competitor share signal*. Entrepreneurs' responses to 
        news are potentially inefficient: while companies posted in the 
        90 days after an acquisition announcement have similar short-term 
        outcomes to those posted in the 90 days prior, companies posted 
        following the announcement go on to receive less press coverage, 
        funding, and estimated revenue.

      abstract: >-
        Rampant informality in developing economies proves to be a 
        major obstacle to public revenue collection, limiting investment 
        in crucial public infrastructure. The model presented in this 
        paper sheds light on inter-firm mechanisms that motivate firms 
        to either transact formally or transact informally and evade 
        taxes. The formulation allows us to predict comparative statics 
        on a variety of parameters, including the effective tax rate, 
        the likelihood of audit, the penalties levered against firms 
        caught transacting informally, and the distribution of firm sizes 
        in the economy. Empirical support for each of these predictions 
        is discussed. In particular, the model provides theoretical 
        underpinnings for predicting the effect of multinational entry and 
        trade liberalization on the size of the informal sector.

      abstract: >-
        Impact investing often takes place in developing or frontier 
        markets, and, as a result, impact investors will likely 
        encounter problems unique to investing in countries where 
        legal institutions are weak, ineffective, or entirely absent. 
        The absence of credible legal institutions—and hence the lack 
        of credible penalties for misbehavior—exposes the impact 
        investor to a wider berth of actions from counterparties, 
        as well as political and market uncertainties often present 
        in these settings. This paper discusses the various risks and 
        describes mitigation techniques.

      abstract:
        We train models for neighborhood and price prediction using 
        language and features from Airbnb postings provided by 
        Inside Airbnb. We find that our model successfully predicts 
        neighborhoods and prices beyond a classification baseline.
