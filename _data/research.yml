        We analyze economies with quotas and other quantity-based distortions. We show 
        that any feasible, distorted allocation of resources can be implemented as the competitive 
        equilibrium of an economy with quotas. Unlike economies with wedges, 
        economies with quotas are constrained efficient and thus satisfy macro-envelope conditions. 
        This means that the effects of changes in technologies, distortions, or policies 
        can be expressed in terms of a small set of sufficient statistics. We provide a non-parametric 
        and nonlinear characterization of the effects of quota and productivity 
        changes on aggregate output. We also calculate the costs of misallocation due to quotas. 
        These costs are expressed in terms of the price elasticities of an inverse demand
        system capturing how quota prices respond to changes in quota levels. We illustrate our results using several examples: 
        we estimate efficiency gains from increasing the cap on H-1B visas, relaxing zoning restrictions on single-family housing in American
        cities, removing capital controls in Argentina, phasing out U.S. quotas on Chinese
        clothing and textiles, and eliminating the taxicab medallion system in New York City.
        Our results offer a flexible method for quantifying the costs of quota distortions and
        the effects of policy reforms across these settings.

        Empirical studies find that the pass-through of input cost changes to prices is incomplete: 
        a 10 percent increase in costs causes downstream prices to rise less than 10 percent, even at long horizons. 
        Using microdata from gas stations, food products, and manufacturing industries, we find that incomplete pass-through in percentages often disguises 
        complete pass-through in levels: a $1/unit increase in input costs leads to $1/unit higher downstream prices. 
        Pass-through appears incomplete in percentages due to a gap between prices and costs. 
        Complete pass-through in levels contrasts with workhorse macroeconomic models that feature homothetic demand systems. 
        We identify an alternative class of demand systems that yields pass-through in levels and highlight four implications.
        First, measuring pass-through in percentages can lead to spurious evidence of asymmetry and size-dependence. 
        Second, pass-through in levels can explain dynamics of industry gross margins, operating profits, and entry in the data 
        that are at odds with workhorse  models. 
        Third, demand systems that generate pass-through in levels can explain different pass-through rates for labor costs relative to other inputs. 
        Finally, incorporating pass-through in levels into an input-output model of the U.S. economy can reconcile the low 
        volatility of consumer price inflation with microeconomic estimates of markups.

    #   abstract: >-
    #     We document a new source of fluctuations in inflation inequality. When the cost 
    #     of upstream inputs rises, varieties within a product category tend to have similar 
    #     absolute price increases. However, the same absolute price increase constitutes a larger
    #     percentage change for low-price products, resulting in excess inflation at the low end ("cheapflation"). 
    #     Since low-income households tend to buy lower-priced varieties, the
    #     inflation rates they face are disproportionately sensitive to upstream costs. Using data
    #     on food-at-home purchases, we show that this mechanism generates cycles in inflation
    #     inequality and excessive volatility in inflation for low-income households relative to
    #     high-income households. This channel parsimoniously accounts for observed fluctuations 
    #     in inflation inequality over time, including surges in cheapflation and inflation
    #     inequality during both the Great Recession and the 2021–2023 post-pandemic inflation. 
    #     Official statistics mask these within-category differences in inflation and thus 
    #     understate the differences in inflation experienced by low- and high-income households 
    #     by 70–90 percent. We provide evidence that this mechanism applies to a range
    #     of consumption categories beyond food at home.

      abstract: >-
        We examine the relationship between customer income and firm markups using data on household 
        transactions and wholesale costs. Doubling a household’s income 
        is associated with a 2–3 percent increase in retail markups paid. This elasticity of 
        markups to household income is two times larger than previous estimates that compare 
        prices paid for identical products alone. We estimate that doubling the income 
        of all households in an economy leads to an 8–15 percent increase in the aggregate 
        markup due to spillovers across households. We develop a macroeconomic model 
        with consumer search that can account for these facts. Consistent with the model’s 
        predictions, we document that retail markups across cities rise with both per-capita 
        income and inequality. Through the lens of the model, changes in the income distribution 
        since 1950 account for a 11pp rise in retail markups, with 25 percent of the increase 
        due to growing income dispersion. This increase consists of both within-firm markup 
        increases and a reallocation of sales to high-markup firms, which occurs without any 
        change to the nature of firm production or competition.

        We document a shift in the market impact of the press conference given by the Federal Reserve Chair at the close of FOMC meetings. 
        Using intraday trading data, we find that market volatility is more than three times higher during 
        press conferences given by current Chair Jerome Powell than during press conferences by predecessors 
        Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke. Press conferences since the start of Covid-19 are largely responsible 
        for the heightened market volatility during Chair Powell's conferences. During this period, 
        we find that the market tends to move in the opposite direction during the press conferences 
        compared to its movement following the FOMC statement publication. In contrast, press 
        conferences by Chairs Bernanke and Yellen tended to reinforce the market's initial reaction to 
        the information released in the FOMC statement. Text analysis of the Q&A portions of Powell’s 
        press conferences suggests that his choice of language correlates with these market movements. 
        We find that Fed communications during the recent period have been less effective in reducing 
        forward-looking interest rate uncertainty.

        How does an increase in market size, say due to globalization, affect welfare? We study this question using 
        a model with monopolistic competition, heterogeneous markups, and fixed costs. We characterize changes in welfare 
        and decompose changes in allocative efficiency into three different effects: (1) reallocations across firms with 
        heterogeneous price elasticities due to intensifying competition, (2) reallocations due to the exit of marginally 
        profitable firms, and (3) reallocations due to changes in firms’ markups. Whereas the second and third effects have 
        ambiguous implications for welfare, the first effect, which we call the Darwinian effect, always increases welfare 
        regardless of the shape of demand curves. We non-parametrically calibrate demand curves with data from Belgian manufacturing 
        firms and quantify our results. We find that mild increasing returns at the micro level can catalyze large increasing returns 
        at the macro level. Between 70–90% of increasing returns to scale come from improvements in how a larger market allocates resources. 
        The lion’s share of these gains are due to the Darwinian effect, which increases the aggregate markup and concentrates 
        sales and employment in high-markup firms. This has implications for policy: an entry subsidy, which harnesses Darwinian reallocations, 
        can improve welfare even when there is more entry than in the first-best.

      abstract: >-
        We propose a supply-side channel for the transmission of monetary policy. We
        show that in an economy with heterogeneous firms and endogenous markups, demand shocks such as 
        monetary shocks have a first-order effect on aggregate productivity. If high-markup firms have 
        lower pass-throughs than low-markup firms, as is consistent with empirical evidence, then a monetary easing reallocates resources
        to high-markup firms and alleviates misallocation. Consequently, positive “demand
        shocks” are accompanied by endogenous positive “supply shocks” that raise output
        and productivity, lower inflation, and flatten the Phillips curve. We derive a tractable
        four-equation dynamic model and use it to show that monetary shocks generate a procyclical hump-shaped response in TFP and 
        endogenous cost-push shocks in the New Keynesian Phillips curve. A calibration of our model suggests that the supply-side
        effect increases the half-life of a monetary shock’s effect on output by about 30% and
        amplifies the total impact on output by about 70%. Using identified monetary shocks,
        we provide empirical evidence for both the macro- and micro-level predictions of our model.

#       abstract: >-
#         We characterize the nonlinear response of output to wedge shocks in economies with preexisting
#         distortions. In the presence of initial distortions, the effects of these shocks on output are described
#         by “Harberger trapezoids,” which generalize Harberger (1954) triangles away from the efficient
#         point. Output is concave with respect to wedge shocks in efficient economies and in economies
#         with elasticities of substitution below one but can be convex in shocks if elasticities of substitution
#         are greater than one and existing distortions are sufficiently large. Our results allow us to
#         characterize when a social planner prefers tax-based interventions to quota-based interventions
#         when regulating an externality, when a positive steady-state rate of inflation may be welfare-optimal, 
#         and when the type of manufactured price dispersion debated by Oi and Samuelson can
#         improve welfare. We apply our results to characterizing the effects of liberalization policies in developing economies.

      abstract: >-
        Impact investing often takes place in developing or frontier 
        markets, and, as a result, impact investors will likely 
        encounter problems unique to investing in countries where 
        legal institutions are weak, ineffective, or entirely absent. 
        The absence of credible legal institutions—and hence the lack 
        of credible penalties for misbehavior—exposes the impact 
        investor to a wider berth of actions from counterparties, 
        as well as political and market uncertainties often present 
        in these settings. This paper discusses the various risks and 
        describes mitigation techniques.

    #     caught transacting informally, and the distribution of firm sizes 
    #     in the economy. Empirical support for each of these predictions
