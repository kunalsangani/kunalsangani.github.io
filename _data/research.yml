      title: Venture-Backed Successes and Entrepreneur Herding
      abstract: >-
        How does the success of an existing startup influence the 
        business ideas that aspiring entrepreneurs pursue? Do 
        venture-backed successes spawn other "copycat" companies, 
        or are entrepreneurs discouraged from entering markets where 
        they will be forced to confront a well-funded competitor? 
        I use ProductHunt, an online platform where entrepreneurs 
        share early product and business ideas, to isolate how the 
        ideas pursued by entrepreneurs change in the aftermath of large 
        funding rounds and acquisitions. Following the acquisition of 
        venture-backed companies, I find a significant uptick in 
        ProductHunt posts similar to the acquired company: the average 
        post 90 days after the acquisition announcement is 40-70% more 
        similar to the acquired company than posts preceding the 
        acquisition. A similar (though more modest) herding effect 
        follows the announcement of a company's first funding round 
        over $100M. This herding behavior suggests that aspiring 
        entrepreneurs place more weight on the *market size signal* 
        from an acquisition or funding round relative to the 
        *competitor share signal*. Entrepreneurs' responses to 
        news are potentially inefficient: while companies posted in the 
        90 days after an acquisition announcement have similar short-term 
        outcomes to those posted in the 90 days prior, companies posted 
        following the announcement go on to receive less press coverage, 
        funding, and estimated revenue.

      abstract: >-
        Rampant informality in developing economies proves to be a 
        major obstacle to public revenue collection, limiting investment 
        in crucial public infrastructure. The model presented in this 
        paper sheds light on inter-firm mechanisms that motivate firms 
        to either transact formally or transact informally and evade 
        taxes. The formulation allows us to predict comparative statics 
        on a variety of parameters, including the effective tax rate, 
        the likelihood of audit, the penalties levered against firms 
        caught transacting informally, and the distribution of firm sizes 
        in the economy. Empirical support for each of these predictions 
        is discussed. In particular, the model provides theoretical 
        underpinnings for predicting the effect of multinational entry and 
        trade liberalization on the size of the informal sector—two 
        questions which have hitherto been largely neglected in the 
        literature.

      abstract: >-
        Impact investing often takes place in developing or frontier 
        markets, and, as a result, impact investors will likely 
        encounter problems unique to investing in countries where 
        legal institutions are weak, ineffective, or entirely absent. 
        The absence of credible legal institutions—and hence the lack 
        of credible penalties for misbehavior—exposes the impact 
        investor to a wider berth of actions from counterparties, 
        as well as political and market uncertainties often present 
        in these settings. This paper discusses the various risks and 
        describes mitigation techniques.

      abstract:
        We train models for neighborhood and price prediction using 
        language and features from Airbnb postings provided by 
        Inside Airbnb. We find that our model successfully predicts 
        neighborhoods and prices beyond a classification baseline.
