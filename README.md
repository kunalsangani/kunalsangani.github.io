I'm a PhD candidate in Business Economics at Harvard. My research focuses on macroeconomics and finance. 

Previously, I worked at [Bolt](https://bolt.com) and the [Boston Consulting Group](https://bcg.com). Other experience includes the [Council of Economic Advisers](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/docs/ERP_2016_Book_Complete%20JA.pdf) and [Google](https://chromeenterprise.google/os/).
